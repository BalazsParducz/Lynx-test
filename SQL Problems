SQL 1:

SELECT gender, avg(duration)
FROM calls INNER JOIN customers
ON calls.caller_id = customers.id OR calls.callee_id = customers.id
GROUP BY gender;








SQL 2:

SELECT count(*) from parents INNER JOIN children
  ON parents.NAME LIKE concat('%', children.FAMILY_NAME, '%')

   Running time would depend on parents name that is similar to children's family name.
   This means that if John is both a surname and first name, it would come up as equal.
   I am no sure what this could mean regarding run time. I am not sure what it would mean regarding Big O


SELECT count(*) from parents INNER JOIN children
  ON parents.FAMILY_NAME = children.FAMILY_NAME

   Running time would be O(n) as this comparison would depend solely on the number of records in the databases.
